Like many great stories, ours begins with a city. A couple of years ago in Manhattan, an Israeli and a Mexican went on a date. Last December we got engaged and soon after decided to leave our jobs, put our stuff in storage and hop on a plane to Asia. We dreamt of exploring the world together.

Some friends thought we were crazy, some wished they could join. All were intrigued and asked that we stay in touch. A blog seemed appropriate, but we wanted a name that fit. It needed to reflect our delight in wandering around.

Root Curious is about sharing our curiosity and joy in discovering new places, trying different foods, and learning how others live.

We hope you enjoy,

Yael & Dan
